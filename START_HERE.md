## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **For AI Assistants:** Just say "check project status" - the apex-maintainer skill will auto-activate
2. **For Developers:** Read DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md - it has everything
3. **main.py is 4,169 lines** - Don't read it all at once, use sections
4. **Tool count is 30** - If health check shows different, something's wrong
5. **Always restart Streamlit** after tool changes
