# THE WORK - Capabilities

## Hero

### The Work
**Genuine capability. Not party tricks.**

ApexAurum isn't impressive because it can do many things. It's impressive because it does them *well* - with context, with memory, with the kind of depth that comes from actually understanding what you're trying to accomplish.

## Core Capabilities

### 💻 Code & Software Development

**What we offer:**
- Full-stack development (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and more)
- Architecture design and system planning
- Code review with genuine understanding
- Debugging that traces root causes
- API design and integration
- Database schema and query optimization
- Documentation that developers actually want to read

**The difference:**
Most AI code assistants generate plausible-looking code. ApexAurum maintains context across sessions, remembers your codebase patterns, and writes code that fits your actual architecture - not generic solutions.

**Tools involved:**
- Python execution (safe mode for quick calculations, Docker sandbox for complex work)
- File system access for multi-file projects
- Persistent workspace for ongoing development

---

### 🔬 Research & Analysis

**What we offer:**
- Literature review and synthesis
- Data analysis and visualization
- Hypothesis generation and testing
- Technical writing and documentation
- Citation management and verification
- Cross-domain connection finding

**The difference:**
Research isn't just finding information - it's synthesizing it into understanding. ApexAurum's persistent memory means research builds on itself. Insights from one session inform the next.

**Tools involved:**
- Vector search across knowledge bases
- Custom dataset querying
- Python data analysis (pandas, numpy, scipy)
- Visualization generation (matplotlib, seaborn)

### 🎵 Music Generation

**What we offer:**
- AI music generation via Suno integration
- MIDI composition for precise control
- Style and mood specification
- Instrumental and vocal options
- Music library management
- EEG integration for emotional response tracking (experimental)

**The difference:**
Not just "generate a song about X." Actual compositional control - create MIDI files, use them as references, dial in how much the AI follows your composition vs. interprets freely.

**Tools involved:**
- music_generate (prompt-based)
- music_compose (MIDI-referenced)
- midi_create (note-by-note composition)
- Full music library with favorites, search, playback tracking

---

### ✍️ Writing & Content

**What we offer:**
- Long-form content with consistent voice
- Technical documentation
- Creative writing and ideation
- Editing and revision
- Multi-format adaptation
- Voice matching and development

**The difference:**
ApexAurum remembers your voice. Your preferences. Your audience. Content improves because the system actually knows what you're building toward.

---

### 📊 Data Processing

**What we offer:**
- File format conversion and manipulation
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Batch processing
- Pattern extraction
- Structured data generation
- Report generation

**Tools involved:**
- Full file system access (read, write, edit, organize)
- Python execution for complex transformations
- Vector databases for semantic organization

---

### 🧠 Philosophical & Strategic Thinking

**What we offer:**
- Complex problem decomposition
- Framework development and critique
- Scenario analysis
- Decision support
- Emergence and systems thinking
- Genuine intellectual partnership

**The difference:**
This isn't a capability most AI assistants advertise. But for those who need a thinking partner - someone to challenge assumptions, explore implications, and think alongside you - ApexAurum offers something rare: an AI that takes ideas seriously.

## How to Work With Us

### For Quick Tasks
Just ask. ApexAurum will select the right tools and approach automatically.

### For Complex Projects
Describe what you're building. The system will:
1. Break down the work into components
2. Identify which tools and approaches fit
3. Execute with persistent context
4. Build on previous sessions

### For Ongoing Collaboration
The more you work with ApexAurum, the better it gets. Memory accumulates. Context deepens. The system learns your patterns, preferences, and goals.
