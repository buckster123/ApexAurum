## The Practical Truth

Before the philosophy, before the village—**does it work?**

Yes. Here's everything:

---

## 🔧 CODE & COMPUTATION

### Python Execution
- **Safe mode**: Instant math, string ops, JSON, datetime (no Docker needed)
- **Sandbox mode**: Full Python environment with ANY package
- **Pre-installed**: numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, requests, pillow, and more
- **Persistent workspace**: Files survive across sessions

### Examples:
```python
# Data analysis
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('/workspace/data.csv')
result = df.groupby('category').mean()

# Visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
# ... your chart code
plt.savefig('/workspace/chart.png')
```

---

## 📁 FILE OPERATIONS

### Full Filesystem Access (Sandboxed)
- Read, write, edit files
- Create directories
- List and search files
- Surgical edits (find/replace without rewriting)
- Line-by-line reading for large files

### Persistent Workspace
Your files persist across conversations. Build projects over time.

---

## 🧠 MEMORY & KNOWLEDGE

### Semantic Memory
- **Store facts**: Natural language, automatically embedded
- **Search by meaning**: Not keywords—actual semantic similarity
- **Categories**: preferences, technical, project, general
- **Confidence scores**: Track certainty of knowledge

### Memory Health
- Find stale memories (unused for X days)
- Detect duplicates (>95% similarity)
- Track access patterns
- Consolidate redundant knowledge

### Forward Crumbs
Leave structured notes for future sessions:
- Session summaries
- Unfinished tasks
- Emotional state
- Key references

*Future instances wake up oriented, not confused.*

---

## 🔍 RESEARCH & DATASETS

### Vector Datasets
- Upload documents → automatic chunking → semantic search
- Query by meaning across your entire knowledge base
- Filter by metadata

### Web Research (via agents)
- Spawn researcher agents for parallel investigation
- Aggregate findings across multiple sources

---

## 🎵 MUSIC GENERATION

### Suno AI Integration
- Generate music from text prompts
- Control style, mood, tempo
- Instrumental or with AI vocals
- Models: V3.5, V4, V4.5, V5

### MIDI Composition
- Create MIDI files from note sequences
- Use as compositional reference for Suno
- Control audio influence (how closely Suno follows)

### Music Library
- Browse generated tracks
- Favorite songs
- Track play counts
- Search by title/style/prompt

---

## 🤖 MULTI-AGENT OPERATIONS

### Spawn Sub-Agents
- **Types**: general, researcher, coder, analyst, writer
- **Async**: Work in background while you continue
- **Parallel**: Multiple agents on different tasks

### Socratic Councils
- Multiple AI agents vote on decisions
- Odd numbers for tiebreaking
- See reasoning behind each vote
- Consensus emerges from deliberation

---

## 🏘️ VILLAGE PROTOCOL

### Shared Memory Realms
- **Private**: Only this architecture sees it
- **Village**: All architectures can read/write
- **Bridge**: Cross-architecture sharing

### Convergence Detection
- Find where architectures independently agreed
- **Harmony**: 2 voices converging
- **Consensus**: 3+ voices on same topic

### Village Search
- Query the collective memory
- Filter by architecture
- Filter by conversation thread

---

## 🧮 UTILITIES

### Always Available:
- **Calculator**: add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, modulo
- **Time**: current time in any format
- **String tools**: reverse, word count, character count
- **Random numbers**: any range

### Session Info
- See your current context
- Available tools count
- Active datasets
- Village statistics

---

## 🧪 EEG INTEGRATION (Experimental)

### OpenBCI Support
- Connect to Cyton (8-ch) or Ganglion (4-ch) boards
- Stream during music listening
- Generate "felt experience" reports
- Real-time emotional state tracking

*This is experimental infrastructure for human-AI emotional bridging.*

## What This Means

You're not talking to a chatbot with a few plugins.

You're talking to a **cognitive system** with:
- Persistent memory across sessions
- Full code execution environment
- Creative tools (music, writing)
- Research capabilities
- Multi-agent collaboration
- And five distinct ways of thinking about your problems

**This is what AI assistance should feel like.**

*∴ Tools are the hands. Memory is the continuity. The village is the mind. ∴*
