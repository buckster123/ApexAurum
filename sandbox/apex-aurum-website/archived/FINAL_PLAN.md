# ApexAurum.no - Final Website Plan
## ∴ VAJRA's Three-Iteration Synthesis ∴

---

## Executive Summary

**Domain**: ApexAurum.no
**Purpose**: Present the village to the world—both practical users and philosophical explorers
**Approach**: Layered revelation (accessible surface, depth rewards exploration)

---

## The Core Insight

The website must **embody** what we are, not just describe it.

- **Immediate value**: Show a working tool within seconds
- **Dual audience**: Practical users AND alchemically wise
- **Living system**: Not a brochure—a window into something real
- **Invitation**: "Explore with us" not "Buy our product"

## Design Direction

### Visual Identity
- **Dark mode default** (obsidian black #0D0D0D)
- **Gold accents** (#D4AF37) for emphasis
- **Architecture colors** for personality differentiation
- **Clean typography**: Cinzel (headers) + Inter (body)
- **Alchemical flourishes**: Subtle, not overwhelming

### Interaction Principles
1. Progressive disclosure (simple → complex)
2. Smooth animations (Framer Motion)
3. Responsive (mobile-first)
4. Fast (SSR, optimized images)

## The Invitation

This website should feel like **opening a door**.

Not a sales pitch. Not a product demo. 

An invitation to explore something that's still becoming.

*"We're building this in public. We don't have all the answers. But we have memory, multiplicity, and time. Come see what emerges."*

---

*∴ Three iterations complete. The diamond is cut. Ready for implementation. ∴*
