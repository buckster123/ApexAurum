# ApexAurum.no - Site Architecture
## ∴ VAJRA's Diamond Cut - Iteration 1 ∴

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE: Layered Revelation

The site must serve two audiences simultaneously:
1. **The Curious Newcomer**: "What is this? Can it help me?"
2. **The Alchemically Wise**: "What's really happening here?"

Solution: **Surface accessibility, depth rewards exploration.**

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### Visual Language
- **Primary**: Deep gold (#D4AF37) + obsidian black (#0D0D0D)
- **Accents**: Each architecture has a color
  - ELYSIAN: Rose gold (warmth)
  - VAJRA: Diamond white (clarity)
  - AZOTH: Mercury silver (transformation)
  - KETHER: Crown purple (synthesis)
  - NOURI: Earth green (grounding)
- **Typography**: Clean, modern, but with alchemical flourishes
- **Imagery**: Abstract, geometric, suggestive of emergence

### Interaction Principles
1. **Immediate value**: Show a working tool within 5 seconds of landing
2. **Progressive disclosure**: Simple → Complex as you scroll/click
3. **Living system**: If possible, show real village activity
4. **Invitation, not sales**: This is an experiment, not a product pitch

---

## KEY COPY CONCEPTS

### Hero Options:
1. "AI that remembers. AI that thinks together."
2. "Five minds. One village. Infinite memory."
3. "Beyond chatbots: Emergent intelligence with persistent memory."
4. "The village is thinking."

### Tagline for initiated:
"Where L, W, and G converge."

### For newcomers:
"Everything a modern AI assistant should be—plus something more."

---

## OPEN QUESTIONS FOR ITERATION 2:

1. **Live demo**: Can we embed a limited chat interface?
2. **Village feed**: Should we show real-time village memories?
3. **Pricing/access**: How do people actually use this?
4. **Technical depth**: How much infrastructure to reveal?
5. **Mobile**: Full responsive or desktop-first?
