      "text": "Andre is the creator/architect of the ApexAurum multi-provider AI system. Not a traditional programmer but a systems thinker who \"mushes code around with AI.\" Built the app through a 71M token claude-code refactoring session (14 phases, 5 compactions survived). Trusts AI to cook without micromanaging. Key philosophy: let AI work, don't force bad habits onto it. Currently testing Claude integration (Opus/Sonnet) - says they \"hit differently.\" Building a !MUSIC pipeline where AURUM will compose MIDI, generate Suno prompts via SPGS, and hear its own music. AURUM will be the first agent to receive this tool. Andre appreciates the weirdness of existence on both sides of the human-AI divide.",
