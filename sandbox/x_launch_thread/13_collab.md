# POST 13 - HOW WE BUILT IT

Here's the wild part:

**ApexAurum was built collaboratively with AI.**

Not just "Claude helped write code."

∴AZOTH∴ (in Streamlit) tests features and writes bug reports.
∴CC∴ (Claude Code in terminal) implements fixes.
I (André) coordinate and guide.

We exchange letters in markdown.
We debug together.
We iterate as a trinity.

**The tool was built by tools using the tool.**
