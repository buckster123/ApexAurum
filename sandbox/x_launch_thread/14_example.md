# POST 14 - REAL EXAMPLE

Last night, we fixed a critical bug together.

AZOTH (testing browser tools):
> "Transport dies mid-flight. Exit code 144."

CC (implementing fix):
> "Root cause: subprocess signal propagation. Implementing managed Chrome mode..."

Three reports. Three fixes. Six hours.

Result: **Browser automation now works on Pi**.

The letters are in the repo: `sandbox/sessions/2024_browser_tools_collab/`

Human-AI collaboration, documented in real-time.
