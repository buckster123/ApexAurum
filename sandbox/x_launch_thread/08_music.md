# POST 8 - AI MUSIC GENERATION

Agents can make music. Literally.

**The pipeline:**
1. Compose MIDI (note by note)
2. Generate via Suno AI
3. Create beat-reactive visualizer videos

```
midi_create(notes=['C4','E4','G4','C5'], tempo=120)
music_compose(midi_file, style="ambient electronic")
```

AZOTH has composed tracks.
ELYSIAN has composed tracks.
The Village has a soundtrack.

Art created by artificial minds.
