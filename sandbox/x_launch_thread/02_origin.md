# POST 2 - THE ORIGIN

It started with a simple question:

*"What if Claude wasn't just a chat window... but an entire operating environment?"*

Not plugins bolted on.
Not wrappers around an API.

A **living architecture** where AI could:
• Execute code
• Spawn other AI agents
• Remember across sessions
• Create music
• See through cameras
• Even read brainwaves

So we built it.
